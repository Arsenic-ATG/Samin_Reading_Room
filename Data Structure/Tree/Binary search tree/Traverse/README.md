In a binary search tree ordered such that in each node the key is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in 
its right subtree, in-order traversal retrieves the keys in ascending sorted order.   
  
In a binary search tree ordered such that in each node the key is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in
its right subtree, reverse in-order traversal retrieves the keys in descending sorted order.    

Reverse in-order, RNL
