Inside a project if there have "index.js" then the browser automatically treat that page as main page, we don't have to 
tell browser to load the page.
ex: if a project has 'sazin.com/weather/index.html' then we can just type 'sazin.com/weather', but if there is no index file
    then we have to tell explicitly browser to load the page or have to type the full path.
