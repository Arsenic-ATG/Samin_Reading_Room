The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:  
 ----------------------------  
Abstraction  
Encapsulation  
Inheritance  
Polymorphism  



There are four combinations of (shared, accessible) pairs. All four are available to you:    

public static variable is shared and accessible outside the class  
private static variable is shared, but not accessible outside the class  
public non-static variable is not shared, but accessible outside the class  
private non-static variable is neither shared nor accessible outside the class
