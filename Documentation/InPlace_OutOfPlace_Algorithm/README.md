In-place algorithms are a type of algorithm in computer science that do not require additional 
space for their operation. Additional variables that consume a small amount of nonconstant 
memory are acceptable. This extra space should be less than O(log\space n)O(log n), however, 
below O(n)O(n) is sometimes allowed. The opposite of an in-place algorithm is an out-of-place
or not-in-place algorithm.  
Functional programming languages often discourage or don't support explicit in-place algorithms that overwrite data, since this is a type of side effect; instead, they only allow new data to be constructed.
