// In-place algorithms are a type of algorithm in computer science that do not require additional 
// space for their operation. Additional variables that consume a small amount of nonconstant 
// memory are acceptable. This extra space should be less than O(log\space n)O(log n), however, 
// below O(n)O(n) is sometimes allowed. The opposite of an in-place algorithm is an out-of-place
//  or not-in-place algorithm.
