Hash Maps: Useful for making lookup efficient. This is the most common data structure used in interviews and you are guaranteed to have to use it  
Graphs: If the data is presented to you as associations between entities, you might be able to model the question as a graph and use some common graph algorithm to solve the problem.  
Stack and Queue: If you need to parse a string with nested properties (such as a mathematical equation), you will almost definitely need to use stacks.  
Heap: Question involves scheduling/ordering based on some priority. Also useful for finding the max K/min K/median elements in a set.  
Tree/Trie: Do you need to store strings in a space-efficient manner and look for the existence of strings (or at least part of them) very quickly?

Routines  
Sorting  
Binary search: Useful if the input array is sorted and you need to do faster than O(n) searches  
Sliding window  
Two pointers  
Union find  
BFS/DFS  
Traverse from the back  
Topological Sorting
