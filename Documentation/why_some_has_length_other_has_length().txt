If we need to find the length of a string or array, In Js we have use lange.length  [lang here example a string name].
But In c++ suppose we use the string class for a string, then lang.length()
Note the difference herer, in js only have length but in c++ we have a parenthesis after the length()
Because in js the length is a property of a class.
But in c++ is a method of a class [remember methods are the function of a class].
That's the difference in there.

In javascript --------------->>>>>>


const lang = "Javascript";
console.log(lang.length);



In C++  --------------->>>>>>

int main() {
        string lang = "Javascript";
        cout << lang.length();
}
