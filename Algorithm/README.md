##Floyed cycle detection algorithm....
  - In case of measuring the loop length we can use this algorithm.
  - uVa 350 sudo random number generation problem solve with this algorthm.
  - where in this problem we have find out when the generated number will repeat again
  - because in computer generated random number is bounded by modulus 
  - You can understand the problem if you see the problem -> https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=286


One thing I observe when solve this problem
