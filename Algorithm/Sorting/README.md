##### - Bubble sort can detect whether the input list is already sorted or not.
##### - Selection sort works well for small files. It is used for sorting the files with very large values and small keys. This is                     because selection is made based on keys and swaps are made only when required.
##### - Insertion Sort practically more efficient than selection and bubble sorts, even though all of them have O(n 2 ) worst case                     complexity.
##### - Merge sort used for sorting Linked List.

Sorting in Dart progamming language implementated as when the difference between right & left value is 32 or less, they use regular insertion sort. But if the difference avobe the level then thay use Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm.
