- Think reverse ( like traverse array from end to start)
- Look at the function if function is given. here here this below problem function has already given
    If N ≤ 100, then f 91(N ) = f 91(f 91(N + 11));
    If N ≥ 101, then f 91(N ) = N − 10.
    
 - check the function can be recursive or not
