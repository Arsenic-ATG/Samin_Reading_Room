# [Gufw](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gufw)  
To allow outgoing and ongoing traffiq for a specifiq application or server  
like here I am want to access my localhost server from another pc in my LAN network  
We have to open that specifiq port where the application running.  
For my case I am running my nodejs server application in localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000  
Now I have add a firewall rule from '+' button from Gufw and input my server port there with allowing ingoing and outgoing trafiq
from the port.

Now to access my localhost from other device in the same LAN use:  
192.168.0.109:3000 (in my case)
