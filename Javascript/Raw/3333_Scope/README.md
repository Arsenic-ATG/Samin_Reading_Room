### Automatically Global
    - If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
    
#### Global variables defined with the "var" keyword belong to the window object, but "let" not belongs to window object. 
also "var" decleared normally will be global variable and inside a function it will be local to that function, but "let" would be local to
function, block, statement or expression.
