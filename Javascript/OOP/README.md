### Javascript is a prototype based Object oriented language.  
### So, don't need to define Class for instantiate an Object in Javasctipt.  
### In other programming language we make object from class but in Js we make object from constructor function.

*JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax is not introducing a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript. JavaScript classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.
